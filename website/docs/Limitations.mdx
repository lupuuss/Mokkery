# Limitations

### Supported types

‚úÖ In general, Mokkery is able to mock a type that is fully overridable. That includes:
* üß© Interfaces 
* ‚û°Ô∏è Functional types 
* üèõÔ∏è Final classes with [all-open plugin](./Guides/Mocking#final-classes)
* üèóÔ∏è Abstract/open classes with public constructor and all overridable public members
  * ‚ö†Ô∏è Mocking classes whose constructor parameters are accessed within the constructor is **<u>not supported</u>**.\
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
       Support for this feature might be tracked [here](https://github.com/lupuuss/Mokkery/issues/108).
  * üí°[It's possible to allow final or inline members](./Guides/Mocking#abstractopen-class-with-final-members)

‚ùå Things that Mokkery is **unable** to mock:
* ‚û°Ô∏è Functions (extensions included)
* üèõÔ∏è Final classes that are already compiled (it's not possible to apply `all-open` plugin)
* üî¢ Primitives
* üîê Sealed types
* üóΩ Objects

### Value classes (WASM)

Mokkery supports mocking methods involving value classes, whether they serve as return types or parameters.
However, for WASM, this support is restricted only to value classes originating from the standard library
(`kotlin.Result` and `kotlin.time.Duration`).

Any other value class requires registering `AutofillProvider` that returns some *empty* value:
```kotlin
AutofillProvider.forInternals.types.register { ValueClass(null) }
```

### Calling `mock` & `spy`

Type passed to `spy` and `mock` must be directly specified. Following code is illegal:

```kotlin
inline fun <reified T : Any> myMock() = mock<T>()
```
 However, it is not completely forbidden to use generic parameters. Following code is allowed:
 
```kotlin
fun <T : Any> myListMock() = mock<List<T>>()
```

### Calling `every` & `verify`

To ensure that `every` and `verify` work as expected, compiler plugin transforms the code inside their blocks. This 
transformation currently restricts those blocks from extracting their parts into separate functions. It also dictates that block 
parameter must always be a lambda expression (not function reference nor lambda assigned to a variable). Following code is illegal:

```kotlin
@Test
fun test() {
    // ...
    verify {
       foo()
    }
}

private fun ArgMatchersScope.foo() {
   repository.findAll()
}
```

However, it is perfectly fine to extract whole `verify` or `every` call to separate function:

```kotlin
@Test
fun test() {
    // ...
    foo()
}
private fun foo() {
   verify {
       repository.findAll()
   }
}
```

### Using matchers

#### All matchers

The biggest limitation is that you **must not** assign matchers to variables. Following code is illegal:

```kotlin
everySuspend {
    val matcher = any<Int>()
    reporitory.findById(matcher)
} returns Book(...)
```

#### Composite matchers

When using composite matchers (whenever matcher accepts other matcher like logical matchers), you cannot use literals. Code below is illegal:

```kotlin
everySuspend { repository.findById(or("1", "2")) } returns Book(...)
```
You must use `eq` matcher explicitly:
```kotlin
everySuspend { repository.findById(or(eq("1"), eq("2"))) } returns Book(...)
```

#### Varargs matchers

If you pass varargs as array, it might sometimes lead to ambiguity. Calls presented below are prohibited:

```kotlin
everySuspend { repository.findAllById(ids = arrayOf("1", *anyVarargs(), "3")) } returns emptyList()
everySuspend { repository.findAllById(ids = arrayOf("1", any())) } returns emptyList()
```

While passing varargs as arrays make sure that you don't mix matchers with literals. Calls presented below are allowed:

```kotlin
everySuspend { repository.findAllById(ids = arrayOf(eq("1"), *anyVarargs(), eq("3"))) } returns emptyList()
everySuspend { repository.findAllById(ids = arrayOf(eq("1"), any())) } returns emptyList()
```
