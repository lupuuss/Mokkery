# Quick start

Let's assume we have given interface:

```kotlin
interface BooksRepository {
    
    suspend fun findById(id: String): Book
    
    suspend fun countAll(): Int
    
    fun findAll(): Flow<Book>
}
```

> :warning: **Please read [limitations](../docs/Limitations) section!**


### Mocking

To create a mock of `BooksRepository` use `mock` function:

```kotlin
val repository = mock<BooksRepository>()
```
If you call a method that has no defined behaviour, it will result in runtime error by default. To learn how to change this locally or globally read [mock mode](../docs/Guides/Mocking#mock-modes) section.

To define an answer for regular function use `every`:
```kotlin
every { repository.findAll() } returns flowOf(Book(...))
```

For suspending function use `everySuspend`:
```kotlin
everySuspend { repository.countAll() } returns 1
```
> :warning: **Make sure that you are calling a method of `BooksRepository`! Mocking extension functions is not supported!**

It's worth to notice that `everySuspend` is not suspending function, so it's possible to configure suspending functions in non-suspending context e.g. test class property.

You can move your behaviour config to `mock` block:

```kotlin
val repository = mock<BookRepository>(autoUnit) {
    every { findAll() } returns flowOf(Book(...))
    everySuspend { countAll() } returns 1
}
```

`returns` is quite simple and returns always the same value. If you want to discover other behaviours check [answers](../docs/Guides/Answers) guide!

If a method accepts parameters, you can define an answer only for specific parameters:
```kotlin
everySuspend { repository.findById("1") } returns Book(id = "1", ...)
everySuspend { repository.findById("2") } returns Book(id = "1", ...)

repository.findById("1") // returns Book(id = "1", ...)
repository.findById("2") // returns Book(id = "2", ...)
repository.findById("3") // error - answer not defined
```

To accept more broad range of parameter values use [matchers](../docs/Guides/Matchers):
```kotlin
everySuspend { repository.findById(any()) } returns Book(id = "1", ...)

repository.findById("1") // returns Book(id = "1", ...)
repository.findById("2") // returns Book(id = "1", ...)
repository.findById("3") // returns Book(id = "1", ...)
```
> :warning: **When multiple answers match a call, the one defined later takes precedence.**

### Verifying

To verify that some calls occured use `verify`:
```kotlin
verify {
    repository.findAll()
}
```

If you want to verify suspending functions use `verifySuspend`:
```kotlin
verifySuspend {
    repository.countAll()
}
```

By default, `verify` works in [soft](../docs/Guides/Verifying#soft-modes-family) mode. It checks if each call pattern occured at least once.

In this mode, each verification is performed independently so in example below, both verifications have the same result:

```kotlin
repository.findAll()
repository.findAll()

// verification passes, because findAll was called at least once
verify {
    repository.findAll()
}

// verification passes, because findAll was called at least once
// the only difference is that `findAll` check is duplicated
verify {
    repository.findAll()
    repository.findAll()
}
```

In conclusion, there is no point of putting duplicated patterns in `verify` with [soft](../docs/Guides/Verifying#soft-modes-family) mode.
