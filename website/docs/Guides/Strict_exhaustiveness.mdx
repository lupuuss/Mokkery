description: Enforce strict exhaustiveness checks with `MokkerySuiteScope`!

# Strict exhaustiveness

Let's consider the following example:

```kotlin
class ClassTest {
     private val a = mock<A>()
     private val b = mock<B>()

     @Test
     fun test() {
         a.call(1)
         b.call(2)
         // Verification passes
         verify(exhaustive) {
             a.call(1)
         }
     }
}
```

This behavior is expected since Mokkery can only enforce exhaustiveness checks for mocks used within the `verify` block.

To address this limitation, Mokkery `2.7.0` introduces `MokkerySuiteScope`.

:::warning
This approach is meaningful only when using exhaustive verification modes, such as `exhaustive` and `exhaustiveOrder`, or when using `verifyNoMoreCalls`.
:::

### Quick Start

To improve exhaustiveness checks in your test class, simply mark it with `MokkerySuiteScope` interface:

```kotlin
class ClassTest : MokkerySuiteScope {
     private val a = mock<A>()
     private val b = mock<B>()

     @Test
     fun test() {
         a.call(1)
         b.call(2)
         // Verification fails - b.call(2) was not verified
         verify(exhaustive) {
             a.call(1)
         }
     }
}
```

Additionally, Mokkery provides the `MokkerySuiteScope.verifyNoMoreCalls` extension,
which checks that no unverified calls remain in the scope and can help enforce exhaustiveness checks automatically:

```kotlin
class ClassTest : MokkerySuiteScope {
     private val a = mock<A>()
     private val b = mock<B>()

     @Test
     fun test() {
         a.call(1)
         b.call(2)
     }

     @AfterTest
     fun after() {
        // fails after `test` - 2 unverified calls
        verifyNoMoreCalls()
     }
}
```

### How it works?

Mokkery provides overloads of mock creation functions as extensions of `MokkerySuiteScope`.
Mocks created this way become part of the given scope.

Similarly, Mokkery provides overloads of `verify` and `verifySuspend` as extensions of `MokkerySuiteScope`.
These overloads make verification aware of all mocks in the scope, ensuring stricter exhaustiveness checks.

```kotlin
class ClassTest : MokkerySuiteScope {
     private val a = mock<A>() // <-- This calls `fun MokkerySuiteScope.mock(...)`, not `fun mock(...)`
     private val b = mock<B>() // <-- Same as above

     @Test
     fun test() {
         a.call(1)
         b.call(2)
         // Verification fails - b.call(2) was not verified
         verify(exhaustive) { // <-- This calls `fun MokkerySuiteScope.verify(...)`, not `fun verify(...)`
             a.call(1)
         }
     }
}
```

### Manual scope creation

If you cannot mark your test class with `MokkerySuiteScope`, create an instance using the `MokkerySuiteScope` function.

```kotlin
with(MokkerySuiteScope()) {
    val a = mock<A>()
    val b = mock<B>()
    a.call(1)
    b.call(2)
    // Verification fails
    // Unverified call: b.call(2)
    verify(exhaustive) {
        a.call(1)
    }
}
```
