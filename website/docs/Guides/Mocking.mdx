# Mocking

Let's assume we have given interface:

```kotlin
interface BooksRepository {

    suspend fun findById(id: String): Book

    suspend fun countAll(): Int

    fun findAll(): Flow<Book>
}
```
:::warning
Please read [limitations](../Limitations) section!
:::

Mock tracks all method calls and allows [defining their answers](#defining-answers).

To create a mock of `BooksRepository` use `mock` function:

```kotlin
val repository = mock<BooksRepository>()
```
If you call a method that has no defined behaviour, runtime exception is thrown. It's dictated by `MockMode.strict`.
    
### Mock modes

Mokkery provides 4 modes for missing answers.

#### Strict

It is the default mode that fails on missing answers.

```kotlin
import dev.mokkery.MockMode.strict

val repository = mock<BookRepository>(strict)
```
#### AutoUnit

Just like [strict](#Strict) but it does not fail on Unit returning methods.

```kotlin
import dev.mokkery.MockMode.autoUnit

val repository = mock<BookRepository>(autoUnit)
```

#### Autofill

Returns empty values e.g. 0 for numbers, "" for string and null for complex types.
```kotlin
import dev.mokkery.MockMode.autofill

val repository = mock<BookRepository>(autofill)
```

#### Original

Calls super implementation if available (default implementation for interface). Otherwise, it fails.
Useful for mocking types highly dependant on default behaviour.
```kotlin
import dev.mokkery.MockMode.original

val repository = mock<BookRepository>(original)
```

#### Default mock mode

It is possible to change the default `MockMode` on the Gradle plugin level like this:

```kotlin
import dev.mokkery.MockMode

mokkery {
    defaultMockMode.set(MockMode.autoUnit)
}
```

### Defining answers

To define an answer for regular function use `every`:
```kotlin
every { repository.findAll() } returns flowOf(Book(...))
```
For suspending function use `everySuspend`:
```kotlin
everySuspend { repository.countAll() } returns 1
```
:::danger
Make sure that you are calling a method of mock type! Mocking extension functions is not supported!
:::

It's worth to notice that `everySuspend` is not suspending function, so it's possible to configure suspending functions in non-suspending context e.g. test class property.

You can move your behaviour config to `mock` block:

```kotlin
val repository = mock<BookRepository>(autoUnit) {
    every { findAll() } returns flowOf(Book(...))
    everySuspend { countAll() } returns 1
}
```
`returns` is quite simple and returns always the same value. If you want to discover other behaviours check [answers](../Guides/Answers) guide!

If a method accepts parameters, you can define an answer only for specific parameters:
```kotlin
everySuspend { repository.findById("1") } returns Book(id = "1", ...)
everySuspend { repository.findById("2") } returns Book(id = "1", ...)

repository.findById("1") // returns Book(id = "1", ...)
repository.findById("2") // returns Book(id = "2", ...)
repository.findById("3") // error - answer not defined
```

To accept more broad range of parameter values use [matchers](../Guides/Matchers):
```kotlin
everySuspend { repository.findById(any()) } returns Book(id = "1", ...)

repository.findById("1") // returns Book(id = "1", ...)
repository.findById("2") // returns Book(id = "1", ...)
repository.findById("3") // returns Book(id = "1", ...)
```

In case of a call that matches more than one answer, the later defined takes precedence:

```kotlin
// this answer is unreachable as the later defined matches all possible calls
everySuspend { repository.findById("1") } returns Book(id = "1", ...) 
everySuspend { repository.findById(any()) } returns Book(id = "2", ...)

repository.findById("1") // returns Book(id = "2", ...)
```

### Resetting answers

To reset all defined answers use `resetAnswers`:

```kotlin
everySuspend { repository.findById("1") } returns Book(id = "1", ...)

resetAnswers(repository)

repository.findById("1") // error - answer not defined
```

### Abstract/open class with final members

By default, it is illegal to mock `open` or `abstract` types with `final` (`inline` included) members.

You can ignore those members with following Gradle options:

```kotlin
mokkery {
    ignoreInlineMembers.set(true) // ignores only inline members
    ignoreFinalMembers.set(true)  // ignores final members (inline included)
}
```

With given flags, Mokkery ignores illegal members, but it's still not possible to change their behaviour or
track them. It's possible only for overridable methods.

### Final classes

Mocking final classes that are already compiled is currently not possible. This includes any class defined in the main
source set. However, you can "open" your final classes from main source set using [all-open plugin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/all-open-plugin.html#gradle).

Apply the `all-open` plugin:

```kotlin title="build.gradle.kts"
plugins {
    // ...
    kotlin("plugin.allopen")
}
```

Define an annotation:

```kotlin
package your.package

annotation class OpenForMokkery()
```

Add `OpenForMokkery` to final classes that you want to mock:

```kotlin
@OpenForMokkery
class Foo {

    fun foo() = Unit
}
```

Configure `all-open` plugin:

```kotlin title="build.gradle.kts"
allOpen {
    annotation("your.package.OpenForMokkery")
}
```

:::danger
Specified classes are now open in production.
This should be fine for apps but can be problematic if your artifacts are consumed by other libraries.
Refer to [this section](#avoid-opening-production-code) for further guidance.
:::

#### Avoid opening production code

To avoid opening classes in production, you can conditionally apply the `allOpen` configuration based on whether a testing task is being executed:

```kotlin title="build.gradle.kts"
// this check might require adjustment depending on your project type and the tasks that you use
// `endsWith("Test")` works with "*Test" tasks from Multiplafrom projects, but it does not include tasks like `check`
fun isTestingTask(name: String) = name.endsWith("Test")

val isTesting = gradle
    .startParameter
    .taskNames
    .any(::isTestingTask)

if (isTesting) allOpen { /* ... */ }

```
:::danger
 `gradle.startParameter.taskNames` only includes explicitly selected tasks.
 If you run a task that depends on a test task but does not match `isTestingTask`, the `all-open` plugin will not be configured.
 Adjust the task name condition based on your project type and the tasks you use.
